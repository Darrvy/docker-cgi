# This a a combined configuration file provided for illustrative purposes.
# 	It contains both the sample.htaccess and the sample.docker-cgi files.
#
# Both files are needed to enable the execution of a CGI program within a container.
# These two files provide the necessary directives to the Apache server to define
# a "Handler" to be invoked for a file with the extension of .docker-cgi.
#
# 
#
# The following actions are taken, with a client URL of the form: https:///~/directory/

#   1. The file "sample.docker-cgi" is selected as the program of choice.
# 	2. Due to the ".docker-cgi" extension, the "/cgi-bin/docker-cgi" handler is executed.
#   3. The handler sources the configuration file: sample.docker-cgi
#   4. The handler then performs the necessary steps to invoke the program "program1"
#      which is defined within container.  
#			- all necessary CGI environment variables, as well as those defined via ENVS
#			  is passed to "program1"
#			- all additional headers are include in the final HTTP response.
